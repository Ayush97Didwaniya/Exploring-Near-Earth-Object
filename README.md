# Exploring-Near-Earth-Object

We have used Python to search for and explore close approaches of near-Earth objects (NEOs), using data from NASA/JPL's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.

# Objectives
- Represent structured data in Python.
- Extract data from structured files into Python.
- Transform the data within Python according to some desired behavior.
- Save the results in a structured way to a file.

# Data Set
We have used two data files in this project which we get from 
1. Small-Bodies Dataset 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) provides a [web interface](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb_query.cgi) 
to their database of "small bodies" - mostly asteroids and comets - in the solar system. A subset of these small bodies are near-Earth objects (NEOs)
file path in project : `data/neos.csv`
2. Close Approach Dataset
NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) also provides data about close approaches of NEOs to Earth. 
Get Url to used to fetch the data from closeapproach data set API: [API](https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/cad.api?date-min=1900-01-01&date-max=2100-01-01&dist-max=1)
